# 🏢 Organizational Isolation & Drag & Drop Implementation

I've implemented the two key features you requested:

## ✅ 1. Organizational Isolation for Tasks

### **What Was Added:**

#### **Backend Changes:**
- ✅ **Added `organizationId` field** to `CreateTaskDto`, `UpdateTaskDto`, and `TaskQueryDto`
- ✅ **Task filtering by organization** in the API (already implemented in TaskService)
- ✅ **RBAC enforcement** ensures users only see their organization's tasks

#### **Frontend Changes:**
- ✅ **Organization selector** for OWNERs to view different organization tasks
- ✅ **Automatic organizational filtering** in task loading
- ✅ **Task creation with organizational context** 
- ✅ **Access control checks** before displaying tasks

### **How It Works:**

#### **For Regular Users (Admin/Viewer):**
- 👤 **See ONLY their organization's tasks**
- 🚫 **Cannot access other organization's data**
- ✅ **Automatic filtering** by their `organizationId`

#### **For OWNERs:**
- 👑 **Can view their own organization's tasks**
- 👑 **Can view child organization's tasks** (if they're in a parent org)
- 🎛️ **Organization selector dropdown** to switch between accessible orgs
- ✅ **Create tasks in any accessible organization**

#### **Visual Indicators:**
- 🏢 **Organization name shown** on each task card
- 📊 **Task board title shows** current organization
- 🎯 **Clear separation** between different org data

## ✅ 2. Drag & Drop Task Reordering

### **What Was Added:**

#### **New TaskBoardComponent:**
- ✅ **Kanban-style board** with 4 columns (To Do, In Progress, Done, Cancelled)
- ✅ **Drag & drop between columns** changes task status
- ✅ **Drag & drop within columns** reorders tasks
- ✅ **Visual feedback** during dragging
- ✅ **Organization indicators** on each task

#### **Features:**
- 🎯 **Column-based organization** by task status
- 🖱️ **Smooth drag animations** with CDK
- 📊 **Task counters** in column headers
- 🎨 **Color-coded columns** and priority indicators
- ⚡ **Real-time updates** to backend

### **How It Works:**

#### **Drag & Drop Actions:**
1. **Within same column**: Reorders tasks (updates `order` field)
2. **Between columns**: Changes status + reorders
3. **Auto-save**: Every drag action saves to backend
4. **Error handling**: Reverts on failure

#### **Visual Design:**
- 📋 **To Do**: Gray background, standard cards
- 🔵 **In Progress**: Blue accent, left border
- ✅ **Done**: Green accent, strikethrough text, opacity
- ❌ **Cancelled**: Red accent, strikethrough text

## 🎯 User Experience

### **View Modes:**
- 📋 **List View**: Traditional table-style task list
- 📊 **Board View**: Kanban board with drag & drop

### **Organizational Context:**
```
🏢 Acme Corp (Parent Org)
   👤 CEO (Owner) → Can see all tasks from:
      - Acme Corp tasks
      - Engineering Dept tasks  
      - Marketing Dept tasks

🏢 Engineering Dept (Child Org)
   👤 Dev Lead (Admin) → Can see only:
      - Engineering Dept tasks

🏢 Marketing Dept (Child Org)  
   👤 Marketer (Viewer) → Can see only:
      - Marketing Dept tasks (read-only)
```

### **Security Features:**
- 🔒 **Automatic filtering** by organization
- 🛡️ **RBAC permission checks** before any action
- 📝 **Audit logging** for all organizational access
- 🚫 **Cross-org access prevention** for non-owners

## 🚀 How to Test

### **1. Test Organizational Isolation:**
```bash
# 1. Login as owner@example.com (Owner)
#    - Should see organization selector
#    - Can create tasks in different orgs
#    - Can view child org tasks

# 2. Login as admin@example.com (Admin)  
#    - Should only see their org's tasks
#    - Cannot access other org data

# 3. Login as viewer@example.com (Viewer)
#    - Should only see their org's tasks
#    - Read-only access
```

### **2. Test Drag & Drop:**
```bash
# 1. Switch to Board View (📊 button)
# 2. Drag tasks between columns
# 3. Drag tasks within columns to reorder
# 4. Verify status changes are saved
# 5. Verify order changes are saved
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Tasks table already has organizationId
tasks.organizationId → organizations.id

-- Users belong to organizations  
users.organizationId → organizations.id

-- Organizations can have parent-child relationships
organizations.parentId → organizations.id (nullable)
```

### **API Endpoints:**
```typescript
// Tasks are automatically filtered by user's accessible organizations
GET /api/tasks?organizationId=optional-org-id

// Task creation includes organizational context
POST /api/tasks { title: "...", organizationId: "..." }

// Task updates include reordering
PATCH /api/tasks/:id { status: "in_progress", order: 2 }
```

### **Frontend Components:**
```typescript
// Main dashboard with organizational controls
DashboardComponent
├── Organization selector (Owner only)
├── View mode toggle (List/Board)
└── TaskBoardComponent (drag & drop)

// Drag & drop task board
TaskBoardComponent
├── 4 status columns
├── CDK drag & drop
└── Real-time updates
```
